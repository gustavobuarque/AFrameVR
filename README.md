# AFrameVR
Application with Ionic 2 and A-Frame

This application is an example about using Ionic and A-Frame to simulate a VR Panoramic Viewer.

I have an issue that I'm trying to fix it. When I run the app in my phone I can see perfectly, however if close the window and try to back to the Panorama again, I'm not able to see the panorama usign the VR mode.
