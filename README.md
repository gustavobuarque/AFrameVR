# AFrameVR
Application with Ionic 2 and A-Frame

This application is an example about using Ionic and A-Frame to simulate a VR Panoramic Viewer.

I have an issue that I'm trying to fix it. When I run the app in my phone I can see perfectly, however if close the window and try to back to the Panorama again, I'm not able to see the panorama usign the VR mode.

If you want to test in your phone you can download the APK <a href="http:\\www.engramadesign.com.br\EngramaVR\android-debug.apk" target="_blank">here</a>
